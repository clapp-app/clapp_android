# Clapp Android
**Has this ever happened to you:**

You are at a concert, and people are clapping. 
However, you have a drink in your hand so you only have one hand free, and you can't clap properly. 

No more! With Clapp, you can clap with only one hand! 
All you have to do is simply grab your phone, unlock it, open Clapp, turn up the volume and tap a button! 
**Clapping has never been this easy!**
